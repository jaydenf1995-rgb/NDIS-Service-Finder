                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>NDIS Service Finder was born from a simple observation: finding the right NDIS services shouldn't be complicated. As someone deeply familiar with the NDIS landscape, I saw firsthand how challenging it can be for participants and their families to navigate the system and connect with quality providers.</p>
                        <p>What started as a personal project to help a few people in my local community has grown into a comprehensive directory serving NDIS participants across Australia. Our mission is to make the process of finding and connecting with service providers as simple and transparent as possible.</p>
